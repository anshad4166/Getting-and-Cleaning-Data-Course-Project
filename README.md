# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

mean(): Mean value std(): Standard deviation mad(): Median absolute deviation max(): Largest value in array min(): Smallest value in array sma(): Signal magnitude area energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. iqr(): Interquartile range entropy(): Signal entropy arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4 correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window. angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:
